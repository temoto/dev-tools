What
====

dev-tools is a collection of random scripts for developers that some people found useful.

If you want to add your script or change existing â€“ feel free to use Github or email with patch, most likely I will accept it.


Structure
=========

Tools for git go under git/ directory, tools for coding in Python go under python/ directory and so on. Language the tool is written in does not matter. Try hard to keep it small and fit into one file. Otherwise, create a separate directory for new tool.
